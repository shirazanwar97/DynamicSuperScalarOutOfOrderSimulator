# N-wide Dynamic Out-of-Order (OOO) Instruction Scheduling Pipeline Simulator

## Academic Project

### N-wide Dynamic Out-of-Order (OOO) Instruction Scheduling Pipeline Simulator, Microprocessor Architecture

- Designed a trace-driven simulation for an out-of-order (OOO) superscalar processor in C++.
- Ensured program order preservation by utilizing an Architectural Register File, a Rename Map Table, an Issue Queue, and a Reorder Buffer.

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a dynamic out-of-order instruction scheduling pipeline simulator, emphasizing program order preservation and leveraging key architectural components in the field of microprocessor architecture.
